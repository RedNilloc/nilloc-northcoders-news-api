# Northcoders News API

Hello, new developer friend! In order to properly connect to the two databases within this project, you will need to add two files:

.env.development

within which you should write "PGDATABASE=nc_news" (without quotations),

and

.env.test

within which you should write "PGDATABASE=nc_news" (without quotations).

I hope you enjoy this project!
